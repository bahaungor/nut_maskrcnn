# Mask R-CNN for Correct Wheel Nut Installation Detection

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a Mask R-CNN model that can be used to detect incorrect or missing wheel nut installation on vehicles. The model uses image processing and data augmentation techniques to train on a dataset of images containing both correctly and incorrectly installed nuts. The model also ensures the correct type of nut is installed, as there are 6 different types of nuts.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my image processing, augmentation, and modeling skills to potential employers. Please note that this repository is not intended to provide actual training code or to be used for any commercial purpose. The notebook (`Hubnut Detection w Mask R-CNN.ipynb`) contains the code used to train the model and can be used as a reference for similar projects.

## Usage
This repository is in the form of an `ipynb` notebook and is not intended for use as a standalone program. The code contained in the notebook serves as a reference for how to train a Mask R-CNN model for correct wheel nut installation detection.

## Training
To train the model, open the `Hubnut Detection w Mask R-CNN.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and follow the instructions. The notebook contains code for loading the dataset, augmenting the data, and training the model using the Mask R-CNN algorithm.

Please note that the model accuracy may not be high as the model was trained for a small number of epochs.
